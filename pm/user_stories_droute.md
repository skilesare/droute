# Stakeholders

1. Application Developers(AppDev) - Application developers build application that use a mix of IC tech and traditional tech to build apps for their customers.
2. Dependent Application Developers(DepDev) - Dependent application developers build applications that use a mix of IC tech and traditional tech to build apps and their apps depend on the behaviors of other apps in the IC ecosystem.
3. nISP token users(nISP User) - nISP token users have to own nISP tokens to utilize services overed by dRoute.  They stake tokens to receive preferential notifications of events on the dRoute network.
4. nISP governor(Governor) - a nISP token governor makes decisions to benefit the network. As the network grows in importance they receive a larger payment for their work of governing the network.
5. App user(App User) - an app user uses a service that implements dRoute.
6. dRoute(Service) - the dRoute system.

# Form Language

Application - An computer program that seeks to accomplish some type of work.

Event - an event is raised by an application and represents the occurrence of a particular computation on that application. It includes the event identifier and event metadata

Event Identifier - represents a particular type of event

Event Metadata - represents instance specific data about an event.

Encrypted Event - An Event that has been encrypted so that only certain users can decode it.

Event Subscription - A application can subscribe to an event an in order to have dRoute reserve the occurrence of that event for the subscribing application.

Registration Canister - Canister used to map dRoute notification canisters and dRoute Queues to AppDevs and DepDevs.

Event Notification Canisters - Canisters used to distribute notification and queue entries. Event Notification Canisters are owned by AppDevs.

Event Queue - An event queue will keep a running queue of events that can be handled at an applications leisure.  Event Queue canisters are owned by DepDevs.

Event Notification - A event that is delivered directly to a subscribing application.

Implicit Notifications - A set of notifications that an AppDev or DepDev must implement so that they stay current about registrations.

Event Filter - A filter put in place to limit the types, kind, or content of events that are reserved for an event subscription.

Event Throttle - A throttle puts in place limits to the number or speed of messages that can be handled and details how dropped messages should be chosen.


# Pattern Language

## Self Directed Management

Supported by - Message Throttles, Message Filters

AppDevs and DepDevs should be able to decide how their assigned canisters are managed/paid for.

## Message Throttles -

Supports: Self Directed Management

Allow DepDevs to throttle the messages they receive in order to control costs.

## Message Filters

Supports: Self Directed Management

Allows DepDevs to filter out messages they receive based on the content of the message in order to control costs.

## Secure Data

The System should provides secure data so that outside observers cannot divine what is going on with the system from the outside.

## Prompt Notification

The system should provide for prompt notification of events to be maximally useful.

## Dynamic Registration

The system should dynamically create and move canisters assignments to distribute load in the system.

## Complexity Shield

The dRoute libraries should shield the AppDev and DepDev from most of the complexity of the dRoute system.


# Current Priorities

1. Basic Reporting <- You are here
2. Encryption of data
3. Certification of subscriptions
4. Distribution of processing canisters
5. Staking

# User Stories

1. AA AppDev IWT notify other apps of events that have ocurred during the processing of my application STI increase the network effects of my application.

Status: Pending 11

Notes:

I'm going to assume the multiple canister architecture from the beginning because other wise I'm just going to have a frustrating time trying to pull them apart.

We are going to use piplineify data structures to handle data passing so that we have all the pipelinify options like push pull, included, etc.

I had to add the following to matchers.  I need to fork and reference the branch

  public let nat8Testable : Testable<Nat8> = {
        display = func (nat : Nat8) : Text {Nat8.toText(nat)};
        equals = func (n1 : Nat8, n2 : Nat8) : Bool {n1 == n2};
    };

    public func nat8(n : Nat8) : TestableItem<Nat8> = {
        item = n;
        display = nat8Testable.display;
        equals = nat8Testable.equals;
    };

    public let nat16Testable : Testable<Nat16> = {
        display = func (nat : Nat16) : Text {Nat16.toText(nat)};
        equals = func (n1 : Nat16, n2 : Nat16) : Bool {n1 == n2};
    };

    public func nat16(n : Nat16) : TestableItem<Nat16> = {
        item = n;
        display = nat16Testable.display;
        equals = nat16Testable.equals;
    };

    public let nat32Testable : Testable<Nat32> = {
        display = func (nat : Nat32) : Text {Nat32.toText(nat)};
        equals = func (n1 : Nat32, n2 : Nat32) : Bool {n1 == n2};
    };

    public func nat32(n : Nat32) : TestableItem<Nat32> = {
        item = n;
        display = nat32Testable.display;
        equals = nat32Testable.equals;
    };


    public let nat64Testable : Testable<Nat64> = {
        display = func (nat : Nat64) : Text {Nat64.toText(nat)};
        equals = func (n1 : Nat64, n2 : Nat64) : Bool {n1 == n2};
    };

    public func nat64(n : Nat64) : TestableItem<Nat64> = {
        item = n;
        display = nat64Testable.display;
        equals = nat64Testable.equals;
    };

Status: Discarded - I think we can handle this with just an event processing canister and the only thing a user has to do is to point the subscription to their processing canisters
